You can use ps -eo comm,etime for example:

$ ps -eo comm,etime | grep httpd
httpd            5-01:40:22
This shows the elapsed time since the process was started. Mine is showing 5 days, 1 hr, 40 mins, 22 secs.

And after a restart:

$ ps -eo comm,etime | grep httpd
httpd                 00:07

or

sudo gonit status 
 -command to identify all the running processes.
 
 Note the pid of the server process you want to stop (eg pid 2000)
 sudo kill 2000
